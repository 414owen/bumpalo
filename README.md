### Bump Allocation

Bump allocation is a fast, but limited approach to allocation. We have a chunk
of memory, and we maintain a pointer within that memory. Whenever we allocate an
object, we do a quick test that we have enough capacity left in our chunk to
allocate the object and then increment the pointer by the object's size. *That's
it!*

The disadvantage of bump allocation is that there is no general way to
deallocate individual objects or reclaim the memory region for a
no-longer-in-use object.

These trade offs make bump allocation well-suited for *phase-oriented*
allocations. That is, a group of objects that will all be allocated during the
same program phase, used, and then can all be deallocated together as a group.

### Deallocation en Masse, but No `Drop`

To deallocate all the objects in the arena at once, we can simply reset the bump
pointer back to the start of the arena's memory chunk. This makes mass
deallocation *extremely* fast, but allocated objects' `Drop` implementations are
not invoked.

See [the `BumpAllocSafe` marker
trait](https://docs.rs/bumpalo/1.0.2/bumpalo/trait.BumpAllocSafe.html) for
details.

### What happens when the memory chunk is full?

This implementation will allocate a new memory chunk from the global allocator
and then start bump allocating into this new memory chunk.

### Example

```rust
use bumpalo::{Bump, BumpAllocSafe};
use std::u64;

struct Doggo {
    cuteness: u64,
    age: u8,
    scritches_required: bool,
}

// Mark `Doggo` as safe to put into bump allocation arenas.
impl BumpAllocSafe for Doggo {}

// Create a new arena to bump allocate into.
let bump = Bump::new();

// Allocate values into the arena.
let scooter = bump.alloc(Doggo {
    cuteness: u64::max_value(),
    age: 8,
    scritches_required: true,
});

assert!(scooter.scritches_required);
```

### `#![no_std]` Support

Requires the `alloc` nightly feature. Disable the on-by-default `"std"` feature:

```toml
[dependencies.bumpalo]
version = "1"
default-features = false
```
