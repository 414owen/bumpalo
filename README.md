### Bump Allocation

Bump allocation is a fast, but limited approach to allocation. We have a chunk
of memory, and we maintain a pointer within that memory. Whenever we allocate an
object, we do a quick test that we have enough capacity left in our chunk to
allocate the object and then increment the pointer by the object's size. *That's
it!*

The disadvantage of bump allocation is that there is no general way to
deallocate individual objects or reclaim the memory region for a
no-longer-in-use object.

These trade offs make bump allocation well-suited for *phase-oriented*
allocations. That is, a group of objects that will all be allocated during the
same program phase, used, and then can all be deallocated together as a group.

### Deallocation en Masse, but No `Drop`

To deallocate all the objects in the arena at once, we can simply reset the bump
pointer back to the start of the arena's memory chunk. This makes mass
deallocation *extremely* fast, but allocated objects' `Drop` implementations are
not invoked.

See [the `BumpAllocSafe` marker trait](./trait.BumpAllocSafe.html) for details.
